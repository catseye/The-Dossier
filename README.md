The Dossier
===========

The object of this repository is to collect writings by Chris Pressey.

This is complicated by the fact that said writings may be writings
per se, such as articles, or may be writings in support of some
other thing, such as programming language specifications.

These entries are written in
[Feedmark][] format, so in a pinch they can be read directly in a Markdown
viewer such as [git.catseye.tc](https://git.catseye.tc/), but they are
canonically hosted at
[https://catseye.tc/view/The-Dossier/README.md](https://catseye.tc/view/The-Dossier/README.md).

Articles with a published-date are "frozen" and are not expected to be changed
(edits will be noted).  All other articles are subject to change.  In
particular, articles marked *(U)* are considered "under construction".

Articles marked (EXT) are not contained in this repository, they are
only linked from here.
