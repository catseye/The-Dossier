Implementation Notes
--------------------

Articles are written in [Feedmark][] format, which is a subset of Markdown
for embedding curational information.  Just as a Markdown file is still a
readable text file, which is nice, a Feedmark file is still a readable
Markdown file, which is still a readable text file, which is nice.

There are some scripts for managing these files in the `script` directory.

These articles will probably eventually have prettier HTML versions of them
hosted somewhere like `github.io` or `catseye.tc` someday, but for now,
being Markdown, they are readable directly on `github.com`.

There will eventually be a "master index" to be used when linking to entries.
