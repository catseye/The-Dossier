The Dossier
===========

*Under construction*

Writings by Chris Pressey.  May be curational in nature (whatever that means.)
May pertain to Cat's Eye Technologies, or may not.  Subject to editing.

Will eventually be hosted somewhere like `github.io` or `catseye.tc` with some
pretty styling, but for now should be readable directly on `github.com`.

### Items of Note

These are not necesarily "favourite" or "best" or "recommended" things â€”
in fact, sometimes quite the opposite.  It's that they've stuck in my mind
for one reason or another, and I would hate for them to be forgotten.
