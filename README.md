### Games

*   **Games of Note**
    
    These are not necesarily "favourite" or "best" or "recommended" things â€”
    in fact, sometimes quite the opposite.  It's that they've stuck in my mind
    for one reason or another, and I would hate for them to be forgotten.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

Will eventually be hosted somewhere like `github.io` or `catseye.tc` with some
pretty styling, but for now should be readable directly on `github.com`.

Will eventually have an index to be used when linking to entries.
