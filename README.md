The Dossier
===========

Writings by Chris Pressey.  May be curational in nature (whatever that means.)
May pertain to Cat's Eye Technologies, or may not.  They are written in [Feedmark][]
format, so in a pinch they can be read directly on GitHub, but they are canonically
hosted at [http://catseye.tc/view/The-Dossier/README.md](http://catseye.tc/view/The-Dossier/README.md).

Articles with a published-date are "frozen" and are not expected to be changed
(edits will be noted).  All other articles are subject to change.  In particular,
articles marked *(U)* are considered "under construction".
