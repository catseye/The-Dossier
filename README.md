Further Information
-------------------

This is complicated by the fact that said writings may be writings
per se, such as articles, or may be writings in support of some
other thing, such as programming language specifications.

These entries are written in
[Feedmark][] format, so in a pinch they can be read directly in a Markdown
viewer such as [git.catseye.tc](https://git.catseye.tc/), but they are
canonically hosted at
[https://catseye.tc/view/The-Dossier/README.md](https://catseye.tc/view/The-Dossier/README.md).

Articles with a published-date are "frozen" and are not expected to be changed
(edits will be noted).  All other articles are subject to change.

### A Note on Items "of Note"

Many of the articles in The Dossier are lists of items "of note".  This short note
attempts to define what that means.

An item "of note" is not necesarily considered a "favourite" or "best" or "recommended"
thing — in fact, sometimes it is quite the opposite case.  It's more that it is something
that has stuck in my mind for one reason or another, and I would hate for them to be
forgotten.  Thus I feel I should not leave them go unmentioned.

Whether this should include _classics_ — i.e., things that are unlikely to ever be forgotten
anyway — is a matter of some debate.  But the fact is that sometimes I still have something
to say about these, or notable memories of these in some way or another.  There is also the
not-inconsiderable question of when something even *is* a classic or not, as a thing which
is a classic in its own domain still might not be very well-known outside that domain.

So, classics often do end up being included in lists of items "of note", but they tend to
rank lower than items that I think not as many people have heard of, and that I would like
more people to be exposed to.
