Computer Games of Note
======================

*Very draft*

These are my recollections of a number of computer games.
"Computer" meaning "not video games nor text adventures nor CRPGs".  Geez.

Computer Games I've Played
------------------

### Civilization II (Conquest, Windows, mouse and keyboard)

I like that it's not just a war game; you feel like you're a steward of the
civilization you've fostered. It's a bit like a sim game in that respect.
Educational, too; it encourages you build a mental model of how history works,
based on technological and social advances. An oversimplified model, to be
sure, but something is better than nothing. I mean, did I ever really think
about how sewer systems and refrigeration changed life as we know it before
playing this game? Probably not.

### The Incredible Machine 2 (Puzzle, MS-DOS, mouse)

A classic. I like how it manages to unify, to an extent, using the
"construction set" to build your own levels, and playing the level (since
playing a level essentially means to complete its construction satisfactorily.)
I also like how it naturally accomodates multiple solutions.

People sometimes tell me how [RUBE][] reminds them of this game.

Every so often, in a television commercial or similar, I hear the exact same
squeaking sound that the trapdoor made in this game, and I have a flashback to
it. (That sound sample must be in the public domain or something.)

### Dungeon Keeper II (Conquest, Windows, mouse and keyboard)

It deserves mention if for no other reason than you get to carve your own
dungeon out of the rock as part of the game.

### King's Quest V (Puzzle, MS-DOS, mouse)

Alexander takes a mint.

This game is fairly well written, which is in stark contrast to the other games
in the King's Quest series, which are simply painful.

If, however, you like things that are so bad that they are absurdly bad (and
considering what website you're visiting, that's not unlikely,) King's Quest IV
has moments of morbidity that may make it worthwhile: Graham's scream as he
falls off the icy cliffs, and the narrator's jesting about "dying for a drink."
But don't even try playing the endgame without a walkthrough.
