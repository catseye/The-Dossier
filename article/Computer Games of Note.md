Computer Games of Note
======================

This is a list of computer games of note.

"Computer game" is not well-defined here, but excludes video games and text adventure games (both of which have their own lists.)  As a result of this exclusion, it mainly includes puzzles, turn-based strategy, and simulations, but is not limited to those.

This does not include [classics](Classic%20Computer%20Games.md); these games are strictly "[of note](article/A%20Note%20on%20Items%20of%20Note.md)", and are probably too strange or too obscure to be considered classics.
