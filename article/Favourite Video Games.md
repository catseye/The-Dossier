Favourite Video Games
=====================

I originally compiled this list because I figured that if
[Wouter could have such a page](http://strlen.com/rants/fav_games.html),
then I could too.  I've also been told that I have good taste in video games.

Gameplay impresses me far more than the graphics or sound
effects or "realism" of the game.   Music does has some influence
on me though, in that an exceptional soundtrack will count for some
extra points.

These are ordered from most favourite to least favourite.

### Typhoon Thompson

*   written by: Dan Gorlin
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up (nominally)
*   available for: Amiga 500, Atari ST
*   controls: mouse

Quite possibly the cutest game ever.

Not actually a shoot-'em-up, as the author pointed out in his interview for
[Halcyon Days](http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GORLIN.HTM):

> I like it because it's unique, the gameplay is simple but infinitely
> variable, and for me the characters really come to life. Some people
> mistook it for a shooter at the time, but it's really more like a game
> of Blitzkrieg Chess. If you just start blasting you lose immediately.
> Each kind of enemy has moves it can make, and the player has his moves,
> but things never happen the same way twice. It's not high concept in
> the way that "Choplifter" is, but rather a kind of art piece.

### Pepper II (Maze-Runner, Arcade, joystick)

To the untrained eye, it's a ripoff of Pac-Man: fill in all the regions
instead of eat all the dots. But there's something about it that sets it
apart — maybe it's that the action is more frenetic and somehow smoother
(if slightly buggier,) maybe it's because the strategy is different
(more emphasis on getting the power-ups just to stay alive.)

### City Connection (Platformer, Arcade, joystick and 1 button)

A jumping minivan? Yes, a jumping minivan. And European police. And a
devil-cat-thing with a checkered flag. And a balloon that warps you to
other cities. How can you not love it?

Not sure if it's truly a platformer, though.

### Katamari Damacy (Maze-Runner, Sony PlayStation, dual analog joystick)

An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional maze game where the
fourth dimension is scale. Rolling things up is also surprisingly satisfying
and disturbingly addictive. To top it all off, the soundtrack can't be beat.

### Liquid Kids (Platformer, Arcade, joystick and 2 buttons)

Very cute. Quite possibly a sequel or pseudo-sequel to The New Zealand Story,
since you play what appears to be a platypus, and there are oblique references
to TNZS (in one of the secret chambers, the platforms are arranged in the
shape of the kiwi.)

### Lost Tomb (Shoot-'em-Up, Arcade, dual joystick)

Gnarly game, but very hard. I especially liked the 3D effect on the
intermediate levels with the staircases. (Even though it's awkward to control
and far too easy to die on these.) The "word from our sponsor" interruptions
are also quite cute.

There is something coherent and unified about the design of this game that
you don't often see in other games; you get the impression that it was crafted
rather than simply produced.

Well, maybe I'm overstating it a bit, but you get the idea.

### The New Zealand Story (Platformer, Arcade, joystick and 2 buttons)

"This game is dedicated to all maze fans." However, that should not deter
fans of: kiwis, archery, flying machines shaped like bears' heads, laser
pistols, magical fireball-belching staffs, and the like.

### CoolBoarders 2 (Sports, Sony PlayStation, D-pad and 6 buttons)

The only sports game on my list, but that's probably because it doesn't
really feel anything like sport. It's only barely realistic — for example,
there is clearly no limit to the amount of spin you can impart to your
jump. The longer you keep holding X and right, the more rotational velocity
you'll have when you catch air. Whee! And it has another soundtrack that
can't be beat, too.

### Super Monkey Ball 2 (Maze-Runner, Nintendo GameCube, analog joystick)

I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden
mazes that you tilt with the two dials — which is essentially what this
game is. But somehow it manages to be fun. Especially when you start
barrelling down a spiral, completely out of control. The party games I could
mostly do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun
as the main game.

### Llamatron

*   written by: Jeff Minter
*   genre: Shoot-'em'-Up
*   available for: Amiga 500, MS-DOS
*   controls: joystick and 1 button

Fast-paced, psychedaelic, mindless fun, like most Jeff Minter games.
Basically a clone of the arcade game Robotron, but with shaggy, smelly
quadrupeds. And cans of Coke. And Mandelbrot sets...

Llamatron was written for the Amiga 500, but I only ever played a version
for the IBM PC compatible, and apparently this an erstaz version, although
I do not recall where I read that.

### Fall Down

*   genre: Platformer
*   available for: Atari 2600 VCS
*   controls: joystick

A retrogame I recently discovered where two players, starting at the top of
some multi-floored structure, race to fall down to each next lowest level;
the first to fall through a floor captures it, and the player who captures
the most floors wins. Strangely addictive in spite of (or possibly because
of) its simplicity; there is a large element of luck, since you don't know
where the holes are going to be in upcoming floors, but also an element of
strategy, since the floors are low-friction and you carry momentum, and a
lot of just frantic fun running-around action.

### Cloak and Dagger (Shoot-'em-Up, Arcade, dual joystick)

There's something that's always attracted me about being able to shoot out
bits of wall. The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar draw. Not sure if
I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.
