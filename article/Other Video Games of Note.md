Other Video Games of Note
=========================

These are games that I remember something about for whatever reason,
that don't fit into any of the other lists: they're not favourites (but they
might be OK), they're not classics (but they might've been popular), and
they're not items of note (but they might be somewhat interesting.)

### Looping

*   controls: joystick

A very interesting flying game.

### Cloak & Dagger

*   genre: Shoot-'em-Up
*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: dual joystick

There's something that's always attracted me about being able to shoot out
bits of wall. The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar draw. Not sure if
I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.

I remember seeing this at a 7-11 near where my sister was living at the time.

### Super Monkey Ball 2

*   wikipedia: [Super Monkey Ball 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_2)
*   genre: Maze-Runner
*   available for: Nintendo GameCube
*   controls: analog joystick

I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden
mazes that you tilt with the two dials â€” which is essentially what this
game is. But somehow it manages to be fun. Especially when you start
barrelling down a spiral, completely out of control. The party games I could
mostly do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun
as the main game.

Some students had borrowed a video projector from the lab, and hooked it
up to their GameCube.  I played this on it, projected on the wall.
IMAX style.  It was vertigo-inducing.
