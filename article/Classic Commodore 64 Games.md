Classic Commodore 64 Games
==========================

A special collection because Commodore 64.

These might not be as "classic" as comes to your mind when you think
classic Commodore 64 games.  But they're popular enough for it to not
be justified to put them in an "of note" list.

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

### Starquake

### Paradroid

### Necromancer

*   available for: Commodore 64, Atari 800

### Castles of Dr. Creep

### Hovver Bovver

*   written by: Jeff Minter

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

### Whistler's Brother

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but a second character indirectly by influencing where
they go by whistling at them.

### Spindizzy

### Zig Zag

### Zeppelin

Notable because you can shoot out bits of wall.
