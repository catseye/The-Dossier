Commodore 64 Games of Note

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

### Paradroid

### Fire Ant

### Pharaoh's Curse

### Necromancer

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancer_(video_game)

### Castles of Dr. Creep

### Hovver Bovver

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but a second character indirectly by influencing where
they go by whistling at them.

### Ultimate Wizard

### Dynamite Dan

### Spindizzy

### Zig Zag

### Rock Star Ate My Hamster

### Street Surfer

Notable for the fact that the theme music changed tempo to match your
speed.

And for the fact that the object of the game was based on recycling.

highway.
