Commodore 64 Games of Note
==========================

A special collection because Commodore 64.

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

Games of Note
-------------

### Dynamite Dan

### Street Surfer

Notable for the fact that the theme music changed tempo to match your
speed.

And for the fact that the object of the game was based on recycling.

And for the fact that you could, on a skateboard, outpace cars on a
highway.

### Fire Ant

### Pharaoh's Curse

### Ultimate Wizard

*   published by: Electronic Arts

### Rock Star Ate My Hamster

### Night Flight Simulator(?)

Notable for the fact that it was a flight simulator with no graphics.
Well, only the control panel.  Given that you were supposed to be
flying at night over a lightless plain, that's almost reasonable.

### The Young Ones

Notable because they made a video game based on The Young Ones.

### Everyone's a Wally

### Sword of Fargoal

Should maybe be in roguelikes of note.

Games that are Maybe Minor Classics

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

### Whistler's Brother

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but a second character indirectly by influencing where
they go by whistling at them.

### Spindizzy

### Zig Zag

### Below the Root

### Zeppelin

Notable because you can shoot out bits of wall.
