Commodore 64 Games of Note
==========================

A special collection because Commodore 64.

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

Games of Note
-------------

### Dynamite Dan

Beautiful hi-res graphics.

### Street Surfer

Notable for the fact that the theme music changed tempo to match your
speed.

And for the fact that the object of the game was based on recycling.

And for the fact that you could, on a skateboard, outpace cars on a
highway.

### Night Flight

Notable for the fact that it was a flight simulator with no graphics.
Well, only the control panel.  Given that you were supposed to be
flying at night over a lightless plain, that's essentially reasonable.

### Fire Ant

### Rock Star Ate My Hamster

### Below the Root

### Everyone's a Wally

### The Young Ones

Notable because they made a video game based on The Young Ones.

### Pharaoh's Curse

### Ultimate Wizard

*   published by: Electronic Arts

Obviously influenced by Jumpman.  Jumpman with spells and a construction
kit, really.
