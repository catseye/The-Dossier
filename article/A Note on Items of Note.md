A Note on Items of Note
=======================

Many of the articles in The Dossier are lists of items "of note".  This short note
attempts to define what that means.

An item "of note" is not necesarily considered a "favourite" or "best" or "recommended"
thing — in fact, sometimes it is quite the opposite case.  It's more that it is something
that has stuck in my mind for one reason or another, and I would hate for them to be
forgotten.  Thus I feel I should not leave them go unmentioned.

Whether this should include classics — i.e., things that are unlikely to ever be forgotten
anyway — is a matter of some debate.  But the fact is that I still have something to say
about them sometimes, or notable memories of them in some way or another.  There is also
the not-inconsiderable question about when something is a classic or not, as even classics
in a limited domain might not be very well-known outside that domain.

So, classics often do end up being included in lists of items "of note", but they tend to
rank lower than items that I think not as many people have heard of, and that I would like
more people to be exposed to.

Lists of items of note also tend to be "living documents" rather than having a fixed
published-on date.
