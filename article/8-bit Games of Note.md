I have no words.  It seemed very high-concept, at the time.  Possibly because
the enemy agents did things quite independently of what you were doing.
Possibly because you have a crude inventory.  Possibly because the different
locations were shown at different scale.

The epithet "Russki" seems pretty dated, not to say obsolete, now, but there
was a Cold War on at the time, you know!

I like how the signs on the streets helpfully tell you that they are ONE WAY.

### Dynamite Dan

Beautiful graphics.  Since the antagonists were implemented with "soft sprites"
(groups of programmable characters), all(?) 8 hardware sprites were free to
be used for the protagonist in a composite fashion that was both hi-res and
multicolour.  The music is also good.  The game itself is quite hard.

### Street Surfer

In the mid-80's, when skateboarding became popular, a rash of such games
appeared: Skate or Die, Skate Rock, and so forth.  But this one made all
of those look quite banal.

For one thing, Street Surfer was probably one of the first games based on
recycling.  The object is to collect and recycle as many glass bottles as
possible.

Also notable for the fact that you could, on a skateboard, outpace cars on a
highway.

Also notable for the fact that the theme music changes tempo to match your
speed.

### Pharaoh's Curse

*   available for: Commodore 64, VIC 20
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D1923)
*   entry @ [c64-wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Pharaoh%27s_Curse)

It's difficult to say what contributes to this game's overall charm.

You can shoot the mummy, but the mummy can shoot back.

The triggers trigger traps on a delay which is perfectly predictable, so it
adds an element of timing to the game.

Also: the bird.

### Fire Ant

*   available for: Commodore 64
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=916)
*   entry @ [c64-wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Fire_Ant)
*   controls: joystick

Once I got used to the "tight handling" of the protagonist with the joystick,
I liked this game a lot.  The premise is cute.  Each level introduces new
things which you don't know what they do, and is not just a combination of
known mechanisms.

### Necromancer

*   available for: Commodore 64, Atari 800

It's a good example of a game which combines fast-pacing with variety
while maintaining coherence across the variety.  The Wikipedia article
explains it better than I can.
