I have no words.  It seemed very high-concept, at the time.  Possibly because
the enemy agents did things quite independently of what you were doing.

I liked how the signs on the streets helpfully told you that they were ONE WAY.

### Dynamite Dan

Beautiful graphics.  Since the antagonists were implemented with "soft sprites"
(groups of programmable characters), all(?) 8 hardware sprites were free to
be used for the protagonist in a composite fashion that was both hi-res and
multicolour.  The music was also good.  The game itself was quite hard.

### Street Surfer

Notable for the fact that the theme music changed tempo to match your
speed.

And for the fact that the object of the game was based on recycling.

And for the fact that you could, on a skateboard, outpace cars on a
highway.

### Night Flight, an I.F.R. Simulator

*   written by: Tim Gerchmez
*   available for: Commodore 64

Notable for the fact that it was a flight simulator with no graphics.
Well, only the control panel.  Given that you were supposed to be
flying at night over a lightless plain, that's essentially reasonable.

In fact IFR simulators were "a thing" and there are more than one for
the Commodore 64, but this one is for the C64 only and is freeware.

### Fire Ant
