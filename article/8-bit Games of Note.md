*   walkthrough @ [gamefaqs](https://www.gamefaqs.com/appleii/580574-russki-duck/faqs)

I have no words.  It seemed very high-concept, at the time.

### Dynamite Dan

*   available for: Commodore 64

Beautiful hi-res graphics.

### Street Surfer

*   available for: Commodore 64

Notable for the fact that the theme music changed tempo to match your
speed.

And for the fact that the object of the game was based on recycling.

And for the fact that you could, on a skateboard, outpace cars on a
highway.

### Night Flight

*   available for: Commodore 64

Notable for the fact that it was a flight simulator with no graphics.
Well, only the control panel.  Given that you were supposed to be
flying at night over a lightless plain, that's essentially reasonable.

### Fire Ant

*   available for: Commodore 64

### Pharaoh's Curse

*   available for: Commodore 64, VIC 20
