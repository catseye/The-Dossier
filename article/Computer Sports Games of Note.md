Computer Sports Games of Note
=============================

This is a list of computer sports games of note.

I'm not generally a huge fan of sports games.
These are recognizably about a sport, but
could not be described as "conventional".

For "computer game" see Computer Games of Note,
but note that in this instance it does include
[video games](Video%20Games%20of%20Note.md).

### Cool Boarders 2

It's only barely realistic â€” for example,
there is clearly no limit to the amount of spin you can impart to your
jump. The longer you keep holding X and right, the more rotational velocity
you'll have when you catch air. Whee! And it has a soundtrack that can't be
beat.

### Super Dodge Ball

Because what dodgeball game is complete without the ability to
actually *kill* your opponents?  Not to mention some of the
players are literally giants.

The basketball game where you are the basketball and you bounce off
the other player, who is also a basketball.

This was a type-in game that appeared in
[Compute! Gazette Issue 49](https://archive.org/details/1987-07-computegazette),
July 1987.
