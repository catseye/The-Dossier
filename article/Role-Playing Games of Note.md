Role-Playing Games of Note
==========================

*   status: permanently under construction

First off, I should note that the definition of "Role-Playing Game" being
used here is, intentionally, rather broad.  It includes things like
roguelikes, pen-and-paper RPGs, fictional RPGs, and computer games which
may not be conventionally RPG-ish.

That said, here is my list of role-playing games
[of note](article/A%20Note%20on%20Items%20of%20Note.md).

### Alphaman

![screenshot](http://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/a/alphaman-315/alphaman_1.gif)

*   written by: Jeff Olson
*   genre: Roguelike
*   available for: MS-DOS
*   date released: 1995
*   license: Shareware
*   controls: keyboard
*   entry @ [roguebasin](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Alphaman)
*   entry @ [myabandonware](http://www.myabandonware.com/game/alphaman-315)
*   download @ [myabandonware](https://www.myabandonware.com/download/312-alphaman)

A post-apocalyptic roguelike which is alternately realistic (I'm thinking
particularly of the weather patterns) and silly (you can be attacked by
monsters called the Bush and the Quayle... and let's not forget the
Venetian Blind!)

One of the best mutant powers to have is Mechanical Genius, which lets you
take apart gadgets (like microwave ovens) and create new and interesting
gadgets.

I had thought the name was an obvious play on "The Omega Man", given the
post-apocalyptic nature of the game, but having just re-read the manual,
the author claims it was inspired by the tabletop RPG's "Metamorphosis Alpha"
(which was itself inspired by the novel "Non-Stop") and "Gamma World" (which
was inspired by various post-apocalyptic novels and movies from the 1950's to
70's, which might well include "I am Legend" and "The Omega Man".) Of course,
he doesn't say that the choice to combine "Alpha" with "man" came solely from
Metamorphosis Alpha, and, while "Omega" refers to "last", "Alpha" and "Gamma"
likely refer to the role of radiation, and well I mean it's all a bit of a
Greek alphabet soup anyway isn't it.

### Mazes and Monsters

*   online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/mazes_and_monsters)

A fictional role-playing game that appears in the made-for-TV movie of the
same name.

I'm not certain if the game itself is noteworthy, but the movie certainly
is, for it is a window into the moral panic of the time, and it stars a
young Tom Hanks.

### The Spawn of Fashan

Solid contender for the title of "Most incoherent pen-and-paper RPG ever".  The
review linked above is well worth the read.  I only wish I could say I have seen
it first-hand, but alas I have not.

### Rock Star Ate My Hamster

OK, so it's a management simulation game, not a role-playing game â€” but could
you not argue that you're playing the *role* of a record label manager?

Anyway, this is great game.

### Below the Root

![screenshot](http://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/b/below-the-root-4v0/thumbs/below-the-root_4.png)

*   wikipedia: [Below the Root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_the_Root_(video_game))
*   published by: Windham Classics
*   date released: 1984
*   available for: Commodore 64, Apple II, MS-DOS
*   entry @ [myabandonware](http://www.myabandonware.com/game/below-the-root-3e)

I never played this much myself, but I knew two people who did; one on a Commodore 128
(running in Commodore 64 mode, of course) and one on an IBM PC.  The Commodore 64
version seemed to have better graphics and a nicer user interface, but I may be
misremembering, or indeed biased.

The game world is immense, and mostly located in the treetops.  So this game naturally
reminds me a little bit of the Ewoks cartoon (they made a cartoon about Ewok life
after that third Star Wars movie was released, yes) and the arcade game
[The Legend of Kage][], in which you play a ninja who can jump very high into the
treetops (and which I am delighted to say I rediscovered the name of by it coming
back as the first hit for a web search for "arcade game jump high ninja trees".)
Even though those are otherwise unrelated.

### Wonder Boy in Monster Land

*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: joystick and 2 buttons

Sequel to Wonder Boy.  It's an arcade game, nominally an action game, but it
plays far more like an RPG.  The game it's most like that most readers will
most likely be familiar with is Zelda 2.

### Adventure Construction Set

![screenshot](http://www.gamebase64.com/oldsite/gameofweek/adventures/adventureconstrset/Land_of_Aventuria.gif)

*   genre: Role-playing
*   date released: 1984
*   available for: Commodore 64, others
*   controls: joystick and one button
*   wikipedia: [Adventure Construction Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Construction_Set)
*   review @ [gamebase64](http://www.gamebase64.com/oldsite/gameofweek/7/gotw_adventureconstrset.htm)

(OK, this is not entirely correctly categorized, since ACS is a construction
set *for* games rather than a game *itself*.  Although it did come with a game,
based on the Epic of Gilgamesh of all things, and it was pretty good, too.
Anyway, let's just handwave over this for the moment, shall we?)

I'm a sucker for "construction sets" (games that come with a level editor), and
a sucker for adventure games, so this would seem a natural fit. It's actually a
construction set for role-playing games, though, although suited for ones
containing some measure of puzzle-solving. The "language" in which the game is
described is somewhat interesting; individual objects can have effects
associated with them (such as summon monster, raise health, display a message,
etc.,) and they can be stacked in a single square; the square can be told to
trigger all the objects when the player walks over it, or bumps into it.

### Sword of Fargoal

![screenshot](http://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/s/sword-of-fargoal-65p/thumbs/sword-of-fargoal_2.png)

*   genre: Roguelike
*   available for: Commodore VIC-20, Commodore 64
*   published by: Epyx
*   date released: 1982
*   controls: joystick and keyboard
*   wikipedia: [Sword of Fargoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Fargoal)
*   entry @ [myabandonware](http://www.myabandonware.com/game/sword-of-fargoal-5df)

An early roguelike for the VIC-20 and C64 which I keep confusing with the Temple of
Apshai trilogy, which it isn't.  I believe it was written in BASIC.

### Dungeon Master

![screenshot](http://img2.game-oldies.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/snaps/commodore-amiga/dungeonmaster-v1-1-0833.png)

*   genre: Role-playing
*   available for: Atari ST, Amiga
*   published by: FTL Games
*   date released: 1987
*   controls: mouse and keyboard
*   wikipedia: [Dungeon Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_(video_game))
*   entry @ [game-oldies](http://game-oldies.com/play-online/dungeon-master-commodore-amiga)

A surprisingly intricate dungeon exploration game from the era of personal
computers that didn't need internal fans. In first-person perspective, and in
real time, a party of four adventurers hack and slash their way past various
nasties, eating their remains, throwing switches, throwing pieces of clothing,
triggering traps, casting spells, and watching the world fade to black around
them as their last torch is consumed.
