Role-Playing Games of Note
==========================

This includes roguelikes.  It might also include pen-and-paper RPGs at
some point.

Role-Playing Games I've Played
------------------------------

### Alphaman

*   genre: Roguelike
*   available for: MS-DOS
*   controls: keyboard
*   entry @ [roguebasin](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Alphaman)

A post-apocalyptic roguelike which is alternately realistic (I'm thinking
particularly of the weather patterns) and silly (you can be attacked by
monsters called the Bush and the Quayle... and let's not forget about the
Venetian Blind!)

One of the best mutant powers to have is Mechanical Genius, which lets you
take apart gadgets (like microwave ovens) and create new and interesting
gadgets.

I had thought the name was an obvious play on "The Omega Man", given the
post-apocalyptic nature of the game, but having just re-read the manual,
the author claims it was inspired by the tabletop RPG's "Metamorphosis Alpha"
(which was itself inspired by the novel "Non-Stop") and "Gamma World" (which
was inspired by various post-apocalyptic novels and movies from the 1950's to
70's, which might well include "I am Legend" and "The Omega Man".) Of course,
he doesn't say that the choice to combine "Alpha" with "man" came solely from
Metamorphosis Alpha, and, while "Omega" refers to "last", "Alpha" and "Gamma"
likely refer to the role of radiation, and well I mean it's all a bit of a
Greek alphabet soup anyway isn't it.

### Dungeon Master

*   genre: Role-playing
*   available-for: Atari ST, Amiga
*   controls: mouse and keyboard
*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_(video_game)

A surprisingly intricate dungeon exploration game from the era of personal
computers that didn't need internal fans. In first-person perspective, and in
real time, a party of four adventurers hack and slash their way past various
nasties, eating their remains, throwing switches, throwing pieces of clothing,
triggering traps, casting spells, and watching the world fade to black around
them as their last torch is consumed.

### Adventure Construction Set

*   genre: Role-playing
*   available-for: Commodore 64, others
*   controls: joystick and one button
*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Construction_Set

I'm a sucker for "construction sets" (games that come with a level editor), and
a sucker for adventure games, so this would seem a natural fit. It's actually a
construction set for role-playing games, though, although suited for ones
containing some measure of puzzle-solving. The "language" in which the game is
described is somewhat interesting; individual objects can have effects
associated with them (such as summon monster, raise health, display a message,
etc.,) and they can be stacked in a single square; the square can be told to
trigger all the objects when the player walks over it, or bumps into it.

### Sword of Fargoal

*   genre: Roguelike
*   available for: Commodore 64
*   controls: joystick and keyboard
*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Fargoal

An early roguelike for the C64 which I keep confusing with the Temple of
Apshai trilogy, which it isn't.  I believe it was written in BASIC.

### Ultima VII Part 2: The Serpent Isle

*   genre: Role-playing
*   available for: MS-DOS
*   controls: mouse
*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VII_Part_Two:_Serpent_Isle

Classic, and would be on a list of classic RPGs, but I don't have one yet.

I wasn't fortunate enough to play this until 2003. This was, of course, long
after the hardware that it made so many demands on was obsolete, and could only
be emulated awkwardly â€” either by Exult, which (when I tried it) was kind of
hard to set up, or by switching between real mode and protected mode thousands
of times a second, which is just about as happy as it sounds.
