As the TVTropes article says, this is possibly the ur-horror video game.
The game uses invisibility to good effect â€” just because an object
exists at a certain location doesn't mean it has to be drawn on the screen.

The "font" in which the digits of the score are rendered is also nice, but
I suppose that's minor.

Notable for at least two things: one, it was an attempt to "graphicalize" a text adventure;
that is, the author wanted to translate [Colossal Cave][] to a graphical interface.  And two,
apparently it is the first game containing an Easter Egg (or at least, the first to popularize
this notion.)

### Yars' Revenge

This game (arguably a classic instead of merely a game "of note") ends up being
a very good game, despite being quite simple, probably because the gameplay
is varied and balanced, despite being quite simple.

It's been analyzed as a microsport.
TODO: insert link to article analyzing it as a microsport.

It's noticable for the early use of a "glitch art"-like effect: the neutral
zone is indicated with visual noise which is actually the machine instructions
of the computer code of the game being displayed on the screen as if it were a
bitmap.
