Text Adventures of Note
=======================

*This is still a draft*

These are my recollections of a number of text adventures.

I use the term "text adventure" because that's what they were called
before they were called "interactive fiction".  It doesn't carry the same
connotations that "fiction" does.  There isn't an assumption that
they have any plot beyond perhaps "collect all the treasures", nor any
character development or other narrative elements.

I would say that interactive fiction is a subset of text adventuredom which
is assumed to have these elements, to be more like "fiction".  But this
property doesn't interest me greatly, and in fact can detract from the
somewhat dreamlike effect that a narrative-lacking, unmotivated, and slightly
incoherent world can have.  I could probably write about this at length,
and I might someday, but for the present article, it is outside of scope.

The criterion for appearing in this list is *oh-now-there's-a-ness*,
illustrated by the following conversation:

    YOU: I was playing this text adventure t'other day.
    ME: Oh yeah, which one?
    YOU: It was called Cranston Manor.
    ME: Cranston Manor, oh now *there's* a text adventure.

Of course, having oh-now-there's-a-ness is not always a positive thing.  Thus
I don't specifically *recommend* any of these, because I don't know what
your exact tastes are.  But I will try to note reasons for why I think each of
them is worth playing or not.

But generally: if it was published by Infocom, it's probably not bad and you
should probably try playing it if you have the opportunity.  The same goes
for if it was written by Andrew Plotkin or Graham Nelson.  It's kind of like
the bar is higher for these; I'll only list those ones here if they're really
stellar.

You'll note I'm not particularly adept at actually *solving* these things.
In fact, with only one exception, when I have solved a game, it was with hints
from friends, or an clues booklet, or a walkthrough.  I don't feel bad about
this because when I've been stuck I've usually been stuck for an awfully long
time — and, in the end, text adventures are meant to be *played*!

Text Adventures I've Played
---------------------------

These are presented in roughly the order I encountered them in.

### Zork I

*   written by: Marc Blank & Dave Lebling
*   published by: Infocom
*   treasure-oriented: yes
*   wikipedia: [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)

I first encountered Zork I on the Commodore 64.  I think it might have
been the first text adventure I played, but I'm actually not certain.
It was a slightly magical experience, anyway, fiddling with the stuff
in the control room on the dam and being told "What a concept."

For the whole story, see [Dungeon](#Dungeon), below.

### African Adventure: In Search of Dr. Livingston

*   written by: R. Fullerton, B. Fullerton, C. Russell, K. Russell
*   available on: Commodore PET, Commodore 64, PC-DOS
*   date released: 1980
*   written using: BASIC
*   treasure-oriented: yes
*   (lemon64): [African Adventure](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=4076)
*   (gamebase64): [African Adventure](http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=20259)
*   walkthrough @ abandonia: [African Adventure](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/842/African+Adventure.html)
*   play online @ archive.org: [African Adventure](https://archive.org/details/AfricanAdventureOrInSearchOfDr.Livingston1997TonyBaechlerAdventureInteractiveFiction)

I found this on a Commodore 64 "Club Disk", but the program was corrupted
and would always crash at certain spots.  Later in life, I found an archived
version on the Internet which seemed to be slightly different.  ISTR the
first version I played had a voice saying "plugh" (yes, like Colossal Cave)
in the cavern.  Was it a modified version of this?  Was it an independent
conversion to C64?  I'm not sure.

An interesting game, although parts are probably borderline
politically incorrect at this point in history (but really, the same can be
said for the original *Get Smart*.)  So far, I've gotten about half the possible
points.  I either can't remember, or never figured out, how to get the wood
without getting bitten by the spider.  I can deal with the viper and the
alligator, but am not clear on the purpose behind either.  No idea what the
foul-smelling stuff or the wild dog is for...

**Why you should play it**: Well, it's not a fantastic game, but it's alright.
It's reminiscent of Scott Adams' adventures a bit.

### Enchanter

*   written by: Marc Blank & Dave Lebling
*   published by: Infocom
*   personally finished: yes
*   wikipedia: [Enchanter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanter_(video_game))
*   play online @ archive.org: [Enchanter](https://archive.org/details/a2_Enchanter_1983_Infocom)

Like Zork I, I first encountered this on a Commodore 64, but only finished
it (with help from the Invisiclues booklet) many years later.

**Why you should play it**: It's well-written.  In fact, if you play the
entire trilogy (Enchanter, Sorcerer, Spellbreaker), you can really feel
the difference — Sorcerer was written by Steve Meretzky, and it comes
off very differently from the other two.

### Haunted House

*   written by: Jenny Tyler & Les Howarth
*   published by: Usborne Books
*   date released: 1983
*   personally finished: yes
*   source code: [Write Your Own Adventure Programs for Your Microcomputer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTYkFJbUswOHFQclE/view)

Note that this is not the same text adventure as the program with the same name
for the TRS-80, nor the game of the same name for the Atari VCS.

This was the adventure which appeared in the book
[Write Your Own Adventure Programs for Your Microcomputer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTYkFJbUswOHFQclE/view).
It was a type-in program, but it wasn't just that, because the bulk of the book
was dedicated to analyzing it.

I grew up in the 80's.  I had a Commodore 64.  I really liked video games.
I wanted to write my own video games, but BASIC was too slow.  So when I
wrote my own games, they were often text adventures.  I was influenced by
the first few games on this list, but especially this book.

**Why you should play it**: Well, you needn't actually play it; instead, you
should read the book in which it appeared!

### The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

*   written by: Douglas Adams
*   published by: Infocom
*   personally finished: yes
*   wikipedia: [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(video_game))
*   play online @ bbc: [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Game - 30th Anniversary Edition](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/)

Like Zork I and Enchanter, I first played this on a Commodore 64.

I was stuck on this one for a long time, because I couldn't seem to remove
common sense from my brain. Whether I had gotten the game stuck in an
unsolvable state, or I just didn't notice that it worked, I don't know.
When I picked it up again years later, I finished it, but I did get a fair
number of hints from other people who had played it, in between.

**Why you should play it**: It's a genuinely good piece of interactive fiction.
It was written by Douglas Adams.  HHGttG was realised for radio, as books,
as television, and as a movie, so it is fitting that it was realised as a
text adventure as well.

### Cranston Manor

*   published by: On-Line Systems
*   available on: Apple II
*   with graphics: yes
*   treasure-oriented: yes
*   wikipedia: [Cranston Manor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranston_Manor)
*   play online @ archive.org: [Cranston Manor](https://archive.org/details/a2_Cranston_Manor_1981_On_Line_Systems_cr_Black_Bag)

Not the best adventure game, certainly, but memorable for some reason.
Never solved it, but pretty sure I could without too much help, if I ever
found the time to go back to it.

**Why you should play it**: That suit of armor that follows you around.
That's all.  Once you've seen that, you can stop.

### Creature Venture

*   published by: Highlands Computer Services
*   available on: Apple II
*   with graphics: yes
*   treasure-oriented: yes
*   (gue): [Creature Venture](http://gue.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?pub=5&item=25&id=2&key=0)
*   play online @ archive.org: [Creature Venture](https://archive.org/details/a2_Creature_Venture_1981_Highland_Computer_Services)

Whatever other merits this game may or may not have, the main feature
is the Oozlybub, a creature which has popped up in a few other places
in artistic endeavours in my life, such as being part of the name of my
programming language [Oozlybub and Murphy](http://catseye.tc/node/Oozlybub_and_Murphy).

**Why you should play it**: For the Oozlybub, obviously.

### Dungeon

*   written by: Marc Blank & Dave Lebling
*   under the auspices of: MIT
*   treasure-oriented: yes
*   wikipedia: [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)

The best thing to ever come out of MIT. (You think I'm joking, don't you?)

It captured some of the hacker culture of the time and foisted it on a
general audience when it was repackaged as the Zork trilogy.
(The Invisiclues booklet explains some of it, too.)

Zork I has already been mentioned, and I had earlier encountered Zork III
on an Apple //e at school.  (It wasn't until much later that I saw Zork II.)

But I first played Dungeon on an Amiga 500.  I actually played it in tandem with
a friend.  I was running a BBS at the time, and I set it up as a "door" —
an external program that could be run on the computer while you were logged
in on the BBS.  So my friend dialed up and connected to the BBS, started
Dungeon, and we could both type into it — me locally, she remotely.

We actually solved most of the main game, but we never got to the point where
we could start the endgame.  (Although she might've later on playing it alone,
as I seem to recall talking about it.)

I have never gotten to that point since then either, but I have worked through
the various Zorks.

**Why you should play it**: It's a classic.  It's not just that it introduced
a parser which was miles ahead of every other parser at the time, the
descriptions are also extremely well-written.  There's a certain economy of
prose that I think is due to Lebling's writing — you can see it in Enchanter and
Spellbreaker too.

### Time and Magik (Trilogy)

*   published by: Level 9, Mandarin
*   with graphics: yes
*   wikipedia: [Time and Magik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_Magik)
*   play online @ archive.org: [Time and Magik](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Time_and_Magik_Trilogy_1983)

I first encountered this on the Amiga 500.

It's actually a trilogy of three games: Lords of Time, Red Moon, and
Price of Magik.

Lords of Time, which is treasure-oriented, seemed pretty well put together
(although anyone familiar with Doctor Who might have a hard time re-conceiving
"the Timelords" as being the outright evil bad guys.)

Price of Magik is quite good, at least in principle — I like that you
start off with 100% sanity, but gradually lose it.  But some of the other
game mechanics, like the combat system, are less well implemented and
actually kind of annoying.

Red Moon seemed kind of weak.  Price of Magik is clearly the sequel to
it (they share a spell system, where specific objects are required as
"foci" for casting specific spells) while Lords of Time is a different game
completely.

All three games have a lot of locations in them.  Apparently this is something
Level 9 was known for.

Part of what makes the trilogy better than the individual games is,
actually, the graphics.  Individual locations don't have individual
pictures, but they do have representative pictures, which generally
match the mood (though not always.)

**Why you should play it**: The multitude of locations.  The graphics
(at least in the Amiga version.)  Watching yourself incrementally losing
your sanity (at least according to a stat.)

### Winter Wonderland

*   published by: Incentive Software
*   available on: Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum
*   written using: Graphic Adventure Creator
*   with graphics: yes
*   personally finished: yes
*   (mobygames): [Winter Wonderland](http://www.mobygames.com/game/winter-wonderland)
*   (gamebase64): [Winter Wonderland](http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=8624&d=18)
*   (lemon64): [Winter Wonderland](http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=4076)
*   play online @ archive.org: [Winter Wonderland](https://archive.org/details/zx_Winter_Wonderland_1986_Incentive_Software_a)

This was apparently a demo for The Graphic Adventure Creator,
but it stands on its own as a game, although perhaps not the best one.

I'm proud to say that I solved this with no hints or walkthroughs, although
I should add, it's not a particularly difficult game.

Note that this is *not* the same game as the 1999 game by Laura Knauth
with the same name.

**Why you should play it**: Well, maybe you shouldn't waste your time on
it, but it has its moments.  The 4th-wall-breaking announcement of the name
of the game over the radio at the very beginning is kind of eerie.  Also,
there's a WOMPA! in it.  Yes, with exclamation point.

### The Secret of St. Bride's

*   written by: Priscilla Langridge
*   published by: St. Bride's School
*   date released: 1985
*   available on: Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum
*   written using: The Quill Adventure System
*   ifdb: [The Secret of St. Bride's](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=0vn91xdqo9yeso8u)
*   world of spectrum: [The Secret of St. Bride's](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006951)
*   (gamebase64): [The Secret of St. Bride's](http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=9845&d=18)
*   hints: [The Tipshop](http://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/info.pl?wosid=0006951)
*   play online @ archive.org: [The Secret of St. Bride's](https://archive.org/details/zx_Secret_of_St._Brides_The_1985_St._Brides_School_a)

Unlike most of the others on this list, I only came across this game in the
21st century, and have never gotten very far in it.  I will probably end up
consulting a walkthrough, if I ever find the time to go back to it.

Intriguing, but perhaps the conditions under which it was written are
more intruiging still; see [GAMES LESSONS](http://www.crashonline.org.uk/26/stbrides.htm)
for one reporter's report.

It was written in, and reflects, an actual environment where grown women
play-acted being schoolchildren in an intentionally anachronistic setting.

In fact, doing a little research — the School of St. Bride's is apparently
[linked to the Aristasians](http://www.aristasia.net/history.html).
Which makes total sense, if you know anything about the Aristasians;
I just didn't make the connection until reading that history.

**Why you should play it**: Mainly if you want to play the first,
and possibly only, Aristasian (or proto-Aristasian) text adventure?
I mean it's not a *terrible* game (although the parser is pretty bad and
some of the puzzles involve guessing at the parser) but the main draw
would seem to be historical.
