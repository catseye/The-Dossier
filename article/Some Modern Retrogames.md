A retrogame I recently discovered where two players, starting at the top of
some multi-floored structure, race to fall down to each next lowest level;
the first to fall through a floor captures it, and the player who captures
the most floors wins. Strangely addictive in spite of (or possibly because
of) its simplicity; there is a large element of luck, since you don't know
where the holes are going to be in upcoming floors, but also an element of
strategy, since the floors are low-friction and you carry momentum, and a
lot of just frantic fun running-around action.
