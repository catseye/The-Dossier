Some Modern Retrogames
======================

Some games written for computers and consoles of old, far past the time
those computers and consoles were current.

### Racked Off

*   written by: Richard Bayliss
*   available for: Commodore 64
*   download @ [tnd](http://tnd64.unikat.sk/r.html)

A very fun game, and notable that there is (as far as I can tell) no
random element â€” the baddies' movements are completely determined by your own.

### Joe Gunn

*   available for: Commodore 64
*   order @ [psytronik](http://www.psytronik.net/newsite/index.php/c64/27-joe-gunn)
*   entry @ [csdb](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=52121)
*   walkthrough @ [c64-wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Joe_Gunn_-_Gold_Edition)

A good game which I remember liking, but not having a chance to play much.

### Fairy Well

*   available for: Commodore 64
*   controls: joystick
*   review @ [rgcd](http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2012/05/fairy-well-c64.html)
*   entry @ [csdb](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=103151)

A good game which I remember liking enough to play through to the end.

### Fall Down

*   genre: Platformer
*   available for: Atari 2600 VCS
*   controls: joystick
*   entry @ [atariage](https://atariage.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&p=308)

A retrogame I discovered in the aughts where two players, starting at the top of
some multi-floored structure, race to fall down to each next lowest level;
the first to fall through a floor captures it, and the player who captures
the most floors wins. Strangely addictive in spite of (or possibly because
of) its simplicity; there is a large element of luck, since you don't know
where the holes are going to be in upcoming floors, but also an element of
strategy, since the floors are low-friction and you carry momentum, and a
lot of just frantic fun running-around action.
