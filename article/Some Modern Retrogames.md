Some Modern Retrogames
======================

Some games written for computers and consoles of old, far past the time
those computers and consoles were current.

### Racked Off

*   written by: Richard Bayliss
*   genre: Collect-the-Dots
*   available for: Commodore 64
*   controls: joystick
*   download @ [tnd](http://tnd64.unikat.sk/r.html)

A very fun game, and notable that there is (as far as I can tell) no
random element â€” the baddies' movements are completely determined by your own.

A retrogame I discovered in the aughts where two players, starting at the top of
some multi-floored structure, race to fall down to each next lowest level;
the first to fall through a floor captures it, and the player who captures
the most floors wins. Strangely addictive in spite of (or possibly because
of) its simplicity; there is a large element of luck, since you don't know
where the holes are going to be in upcoming floors, but also an element of
strategy, since the floors are low-friction and you carry momentum, and a
lot of just frantic fun running-around action.
