Memorable Games
===============

These are games which are not classics and not even "of note" but I do
have memories of them, for whatever reason.

### Big Mac

the maintenance man

### Slinky

holy cow

### Crossroads

type-in

### Lava Flow

type-in

### Everyone's a Wally

### The Young Ones

Notable because they made a video game based on The Young Ones.

### Ultimate Wizard

*   published by: Electronic Arts

Obviously influenced by Jumpman.  Jumpman with spells and a construction
kit, really.

### Swashbuckler

*   wikipedia: [Swashbuckler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashbuckler_(video_game))
*   online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Swashbuckler_1982_Datamost)

The weird contrast between the coloured background vs. the black-and-white
(or green, as the case may have been, on the monochrome monitor on which I
saw it) figures of the characters makes it stand out in my mind.

### Sammy Lightfoot

*   wikipedia: [Sammy Lightfoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Lightfoot)
*   online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Sammy_Lightfoot_1983_Sierra_cr_Mr._Krac_Man_o)

OK, so this is actually only listed here because there was a demo
called "Kill Sammy" which used the assets from Sammy Lightfoot, but
instead of being the game, let you select from a menu the way in
which Sammy should meet his demise (laser, being squished by something,
etc.)

You can see "Kill Sammy" online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Kill_Sammy_19xx_Grue_The).

### Penny Arcade

*   written by: Bill Budge
*   genre: Sports
*   available for: Apple II
*   published by: Apple Computer, Inc.
*   release date: 1979
*   controls: paddles
*   video @ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h67eM0RAdM)

OK, so mainly this is notable because it was written as a machine-language
routine "attached" to a BASIC program.  So you loaded and ran it like a BASIC
program, but all the BASIC part was doing was calling the machine-language
part.  And when you LISTed the BASIC program, all that was visible was 
the BASIC part.

To a kid like me at the time, that made it seem like an effing *mystery*.

### Lemonade Stand

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand
*   online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Lemonade_Stand_1979_Apple)

This is probably a classic.

Summer is endless, unlike in the Commodore 64 version.
