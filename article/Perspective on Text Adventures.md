Perspective on Text Adventures
==============================

*   status: under construction

I'm writing this in order to reduce the number of tangents I go off on in
the [Text Adventures of Note](Text%20Adventures%20of%20Note.md) and
[Text Adventure Classics](Text%20Adventure%20Classics.md).
This is more of a memoir or opinion piece or something, rather than
a curational list.

I use the term "text adventure" because that's what they were called
before they were called "interactive fiction".  It doesn't carry the same
connotations that "fiction" does.  There isn't an assumption that
they have any plot beyond perhaps "collect all the treasures", nor any
character development or other narrative elements.

I would say that interactive fiction is a subset of text adventuredom which
is assumed to have these elements, to be more like "fiction".  But this
property doesn't interest me greatly, and in fact can detract from the
somewhat dreamlike effect that a narrative-lacking, unmotivated, and slightly
incoherent world can have.

I could probably write about this at length, and I might someday.

I grew up in the 80's.  I had a Commodore 64.  I really liked video games.
I wanted to write my own video games, but BASIC was too slow.  So when I
wrote my own games, they were often text adventures.

I was influenced by [Zork I][] and [African Adventure: In Search of Dr. Livingston][],
but of particular influence was this book:
[Write Your Own Adventure Programs for Your Microcomputer][]

This book was probably responsible for setting me off in the direction of
programming languages, too, because it describes how
to write a simple one-or-two word parser for an an adventure game.

"Haunted House" was the adventure which appeared in the book
It was a type-in program, but it wasn't just that, because the bulk of the book
was dedicated to analyzing it.
