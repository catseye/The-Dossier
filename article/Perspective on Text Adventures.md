Perspective on Text Adventures
==============================

*   status: under construction

I'm writing this in order to reduce the number of tangents I go off on in
the [Text Adventures of Note](Text%20Adventures%20of%20Note.md) and
[Text Adventure Classics](Text%20Adventure%20Classics.md).
This is more of a memoir or opinion piece or something, rather than
a curational list.

I use the term "text adventure" because that's what they were called
before they were called "interactive fiction".  It doesn't carry the same
connotations that "fiction" does.  There isn't an assumption that
they have any plot beyond perhaps "collect all the treasures", nor any
character development or other narrative elements.

I would say that interactive fiction is a subset of text adventuredom which
is assumed to have these elements, to be more like "fiction".  But this
property doesn't interest me greatly, and in fact can detract from the
somewhat dreamlike effect that a narrative-lacking, unmotivated, and slightly
incoherent world can have.

I could probably write about this at length, and I might someday.
