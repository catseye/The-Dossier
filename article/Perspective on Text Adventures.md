Perspective on Text Adventures
==============================

*   status: under construction

I'm writing this in order to reduce the number of tangents I go off on in
the [Text Adventures of Note](Text%20Adventures%20of%20Note.md) and
[Text Adventure Classics](Text%20Adventure%20Classics.md).
This is more of a memoir (or something) than a curational list.
At any rate, expect it to be a bit rambly.

I grew up in the 80's.  I had a Commodore 64.  I really liked video games.
I wanted to write my own video games, but BASIC was too slow.  So when I
wrote my own games, they were often text adventures.

I say "text adventure" here because that's what they were called at the time,
before Infocom began labelling its wares as "interactive fiction".

But even nowadays I generally avoid the term "interactive fiction".
I still call them "text adventures" because it doesn't carry the
connotations that "fiction" does.  There isn't an assumption that
they have any plot beyond perhaps "collect all the treasures", nor any
character development or other narrative elements.

It is a more basic form.  It involves a computer giving a player some
text, being a description of some kind of imagined environment, and
then the player giving the computer some text, being a description of
what the player would like to do in this environment, this cycle
repeating until some end goal is reached.

This requirement that the player communicate to the computer with textual
instructions disqualifies things like "Choose Your Own Adventure" books
(or the modern equivalent, vanilla Twine games) from being text adventures,
even though one could argue that they are a form of "interactive fiction",
at least if one takes that term on its face value.

But one typically does not; interactive fiction is its own thing.
I would say that interactive fiction is a subset of text adventuredom which
is assumed to have narrative elements (such as plot and character development
and so forth) in order to be more like conventional, non-interactive fiction.

But this property doesn't interest me greatly, and in fact can detract from the
somewhat dreamlike effect that a narrative-lacking, unmotivated, and slightly
incoherent world can have.

This definition also does not exclude text adventures with graphics.
These are usually still pictures, or with minor animations only loosely
related to the gameplay.  I still consider these text adventures, since the
core two-way communication between computer and player is still text-based.
It's like a book with illustrations.

I don't remember which text adventure I played first.  It was either
[Zork I][] or [African Adventure: In Search of Dr. Livingston][].

These were both very influential, but of particular influence was the book
[Write Your Own Adventure Programs for Your Microcomputer][].

This book was probably responsible for setting me off in the direction of
programming languages, too, because it describes how
to write a simple one-or-two word parser for an adventure game.

"Haunted House" was the adventure which appeared in the book
It was a type-in program, but it wasn't just that, because the bulk of the book
was dedicated to analyzing it.

And (once again on the point of nomenclature) I'd like to note that that was
a frustratingly difficult book to find again in adulthood, because I was convinced
that it had the term "text adventure" in its title, when it in fact does not,
it has the term "adventure program" which is not something anyone, as far as I
know, ever calls them.

(Note to self: these reference-style links will be rewritten by
Feedmark at some point.  They're not permalinks yet.)
