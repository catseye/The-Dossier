Apple II Games of Note
======================

I'm spelling it "Apple II" because even though the actual models were
known as "Apple ][+" and "Apple //e" but most games ran on both, and
let's face it, those names are orthographically horrible.

### Russki Duck

### Lemonade Stand

### Penny Arcade

### Swashbuckler

### Sammy Lightfoot

OK, so this is actually only listed here because there was a demo
called "Kill Sammy" which used the assets from Sammy Lightfoot, but
instead of being the game, let you select from a menu the way in
which Sammy should meet his demise (laser, being squished by something,
etc.)
