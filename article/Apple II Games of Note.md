I have no words.  It seemed very high-concept, at the time.  Possibly because
the enemy agents did things quite independently of what you were doing.
Possibly because you have a crude inventory.  Possibly because the different
locations were shown at different scale.

The epithet "Russki" seems pretty dated, not to say obsolete, now, but there
was a Cold War on at the time, you know!

I like how the signs on the streets helpfully tell you that they are ONE WAY.

### Beer Run

I didn't know quite what to make of this game at the time, and I still don't.

I mean, I guess the action takes place on the outside of a building?  On ledges?
Because the protagonist sidles left and right, always facing away from
the player.

And catches beers that fall from the sky.  Launched, if I recall, out of a blimp
(but this is only revealed once the protagonist makes it far enough up the
building to see the blimp.)

A videogame instantiation of college humour, maybe?

### Swashbuckler

The weird contrast between the coloured background vs. the black-and-white
(or green, as the case may have been, on the monochrome monitor on which I
saw it) figures of the characters makes it stand out in my mind.
