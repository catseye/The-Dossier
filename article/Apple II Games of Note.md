Apple II Games of Note
======================

I'm spelling it "Apple II" because even though the actual models were
known as "Apple ][+" and "Apple //e" but most games ran on both, and
let's face it, those names are orthographically horrible.

### Russki Duck

I have no words.  It seemed very high-concept, at the time.

### Lemonade Stand

This is probably a classic.

Summer is endless, unlike in the Commodore 64 version.

### Swashbuckler

The weird contrast between the coloured background vs. the black-and-white
(or green, as the case may have been, on the monochrome monitor on which I
saw it) figures of the characters makes it stand out in my mind.

### Sammy Lightfoot

OK, so this is actually only listed here because there was a demo
called "Kill Sammy" which used the assets from Sammy Lightfoot, but
instead of being the game, let you select from a menu the way in
which Sammy should meet his demise (laser, being squished by something,
etc.)

You can see "Kill Sammy" online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Kill_Sammy_19xx_Grue_The).
