Some Notes on Drawing
=====================

When I was very young, I asked my parents what you called someone who draws.  Their
answer was "a drawer".  I was deeply upset, not to say offended, because to me, a
drawer was a kind of furniture.  They agreed that it was, but stood by their statement.

Perhaps they did not know, or wish to use, the word "draughtsman".  While it does seem
to be a word that's less regularly used in NA than in the UK, this would have been
a time when it was the name of an actual profession — and long before there was any
pressure to use a gender-neutral term such as "draughtsperson".

Some people claim they cannot draw.  This is a lie.  Everyone can draw; this is
amply attested by UFO eyewitness reports.  (These are also strong evidence that
very large objects are most naturally measured in terms of football fields.)
It would be more true to say that a lot of people do not like *how* they draw.

There are three basic ways of drawing anything: from life, from a reference, and
from the imagination.

You are drawing something "from life" if that thing is right in front of you, even
if that thing is dead.  "Life" probably refers to your own life, in this context.

People will sometimes say "drawing from memory" instead of "from the imagination",
and I see what they're getting at, but the latter seems more accurate.  Memory is
a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for imagination.  I have to remember
what a horse looks like, and what a horn looks like, but I have to imagine what
a unicorn looks like.

Unicorns!  Don't get me started on unicorns.  They're an aesthetics researchers
favourite animal to fixate on.  Because a drawing of a unicorn isn't a
*representation* of a unicorn, you see, because they don't exist, you see, and
you can't *represent* something that doesn't exist, you see, and I know they
don't exist because I've visited every planet in the galaxy and I've never seen
one on any of them.

Anyway, as I said, there are three basic ways of drawing anything, and each of
these ways have their advantages and disadvantages, their pros and cons.

From Life: The result will itself usually have more "life" in it...

From a Reference: Often this is a photograph, although it could also be another
drawing...

From the Imagination: Cézanne and William Blake were big on this...

The artworld does not hold drawing in high regard.  Not like painting!
Painting is like the favourite child of the art world.  Yes, even still now in
the contemporary age, despite what the Stuckists will try to make you believe,
painting still rules the roost.  The reasons for this are probably beyond the
scope of this essay.  Especially since this essay is about drawing, not painting.
