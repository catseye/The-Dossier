Some Notes on Drawing
=====================

*   status: draft

When I was very young, I asked my parents what you called someone who draws.  Their
answer was "a drawer".  I was deeply upset, not to say offended, because to me, a
drawer was a kind of furniture.  They agreed that it was, but stood by their statement,
hiding behind the fact that words can have more than one meaning.

Perhaps they did not know, or wish to use, the word "draughtsman".  While it does seem
to be a word that's less regularly used in NA than in the UK, this would have been
a time when it was the name of an actual profession — and long before there was any
pressure to use a gender-neutral term such as "draughtsperson".  Which is such an
ugly word that, you know, "drawer" doesn't seem all that bad.

Some people claim they cannot draw.  This is a lie.  Everyone can draw; this is
amply attested by UFO eyewitness reports.  (These are also strong evidence that
very large objects are most naturally measured in terms of football fields.)

If someone says they are not a good drawer, that is closer to an honest statement,
but it still presupposes that there is such a thing as a "good drawing", and further,
that they can distinguish a "good" drawing from a "bad" one.  (Yet ask them to do so,
and they will probably beg off, saying they're no art critic.  So frustrating.)

I think it would be more accurate still to say that a lot of people simply do not
like *how* they draw.

The artworld does not hold drawing in high regard.  It's not like that most-favoured
child of the artworld, oil painting, oh no. [(Footnote 1)](#footnote-1)
Let us now recoil in horror in unison over the fact that *mere children* do it.

I would like drawing to be held in higher regard than it is.  Mathematics has been
called "the queen and the servant of the sciences", because it is both fantastically
useful to each branch of science individually, and grandly unifying to the sciences.
Perhaps we could say something similar for drawing, that drawing is the queen and
servant of the arts.  Not just practice and preparatory sketches for paintings, but
also architectural drawings, dance diagrams, set designs, fashion drawings...

Methods of Drawing
------------------

There are three basic ways of drawing anything: from life, from a reference, and
from the imagination.  Each of these ways has their own advantages and disadvantages,
their pros and cons.

### Drawing from Life

You are drawing something "from life" if that thing is right in front of you, even
if that thing is dead. [(Footnote 2)](#footnote-2)  I suppose, then, that "life"
possibly refers to the drawer's own life in this context.

Drawn this way, the result will itself usually have more "life" in it.  Critics use
fancy art-words like _brio_ or _élan_ to describe this.  I cannot begin to explain
why this is, so I won't.  But it's true.

If you go over such a drawing in, say, ink, after making it, you will "deaden" it.

Of course, you can make it in ink to begin with.  Erasing is overrated.

Drawings made this way are often _sketches_.  I mean this word in its literal sense:
it comes from an Italian word meaning "to spray", and means, roughly speaking,
making more than one line, not totally accurately, and hoping the viewer's eye will
"split the difference".  It would be the opposite of _line drawing_, which is usually
interpreted to mean that the lines are clear and are the "right" lines.

But even this is a bit complicated.  A line, on paper, usually indicates an outline,
which itself is an abstraction of a "boundary" in reality where one thing
(e.g., an apple) stops and another (e.g. a bowl) begins.  But it need not.  Lines,
especially when put together closely and at consistently angles, can represent a
_texture_ to the eye.  And anyway, there's nothing saying you need to make lines
when drawing; it's just one of the more convenient things a pointed stylus can do.

### Drawing from a Reference

Often this is a photograph, although it could also be another drawing.

The trick here is avoid slavishly copying the reference.

Taking this to the extreme is _tracing_, where you place a piece of paper on top
of another picture and, if the paper is thin enough, you can see the original
picture underneath, and you make lines on top of its lines.

Some people will call this "cheating".  This, too, is a lie, because in order
to cheat there need to be a rule that can be broken.  It would be more accurate
to say that this results in a very dead and lifeless and "traced-looking" drawing.

But even so, that's mainly because when you make a tracing, you are slavishly
finding an outline, an visual boundary between things, and making a line out
of it.  The problem is that when someone else sees that line, they don't necessarily
recover the same outline you (thought you) saw when you traced it.  *If* you
realize that and consciously try to counteract it when tracing, you can, if not
overcome the effect, then at least mitigate it.

### Drawing from the Imagination

William Blake was big on this.  Piranesi and Tiepolo, too, and Leonardo too, for
that matter, because _invenzione_ was big in the renaissance.  More on that in a
second.

People will sometimes say "drawing from memory" instead of "from the imagination",
especially academics.  Probably because the latter sounds fanciful and thus
vaguely unprofessional somehow.  (I refer you again to the horrifying fact that
*mere children* have imaginations.)

And I mean, technically I can see what they're getting at — you can't draw a
horse unless you've seen a horse sometime in the past, right? — but referring to
the imagination still seems more accurate.  It's not like those prisons were
things that Piranesi actually *remembered*.  Well — unless he dreamed them.
I don't know that he didn't.

Also, I don't remember where I picked this up, but someone pointed out that if
you look down at your drawing while you are drawing it, as most drawers do, *all*
drawing, even drawing from life, is technically drawing from memory.  That's maybe
a pedantic point, but it's worth thinking about: having a good short-term memory is
helpful.  There are probably exercises for developing this, I don't know.

Anyway, what I was getting at is, memory is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition
for imagination.  I have to remember what a horse looks like, and what a horn looks
like, but I have to imagine what a unicorn looks like.

Unicorns!  Don't get me started on unicorns.  They're an aesthetics researchers
favourite animal to fixate on.  Because a drawing of a unicorn isn't a
*representation* of a unicorn, you see, because they don't exist, you see, and
you can't *represent* something that doesn't exist, you see, and I know they
don't exist because I've visited every planet in the galaxy and I've never seen
one on any of them.

The main drawback is, of course, that it's easy to get basic things wrong.  By
"basic things" I mean, the relative length of limbs of a figure, or the
foreshortening, or sometimes even the number of digits on a hand, for goodness sake.
And even if not wrong, for something complex and subtle like the human figure, it's
almost inevitable that the drawer will miss some of the subtleties.  The result is
something that "looks made up".

For this reason, some would call drawing from the imagination, especially drawing
the human figure this way, the ultimate test of an artist.  I don't know, but I agree
that it certainly is difficult.

### Discussion

These three methods aren't intended to be perfectly hermetic.  Drawing from one
of those little artist's mannequins that IKEA now sells as furnishings will be
a combination of drawing from a reference and drawing from the imagination.
But I do think it is a very useful division.

And obviously, the division applies to painting, too.

And actually, once you know about the division, you start to notice it.
For example, Cézanne was big on painting from the imagination, and you can
really tell sometimes.  Similar, later in his career, Picabia made a lot of
paintings from photographs, and you can really tell with those, too.
Photographs are far more unforgiving about lighting than the human eye is.

Books
-----

I've read a number of "How to Draw X" books, of course, but they don't tend to
go into much depth.  (Deconstruct the subject into a number of tin-cans.  OK.
Try different media and grounds until you find what you like.  OK...)

It wasn't until I encountered these two books that I felt I had really found
studies of drawing _per se_:

Footnotes
---------

##### Footnote 1

Yes, even still now in the contemporary age, despite what the Stuckists will
try to make you believe in order to curry sympathy from you, oil painting is
still basically regarded as "the" art form.  The reasons for this are beyond
the scope of this essay, since this is an essay about drawing, not painting.
But since you asked: prestige, portability, and durability contribute to
market value, and let's face it, the art market rules the artworld.  Sorry.

##### Footnote 2

Indeed, the French translation of "still life" is _nature morte_, which
literally translates to "dead nature".  Go figure.
