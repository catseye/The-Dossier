Some Notes on Drawing
=====================

*   status: draft

When I was very young, I asked my parents what you called someone who draws.  Their
answer was "a drawer".  I was deeply upset, not to say offended, because to me, a
drawer was a kind of furniture.  They agreed that it was, but stood by their statement,
claiming that words can have more than one meaning.

Perhaps they did not know, or wish to use, the word "draughtsman".  While it does seem
to be a word that's less regularly used in NA than in the UK, this would have been
a time when it was the name of an actual profession — and long before there was any
pressure to use a gender-neutral term such as "draughtsperson".

Some people claim they cannot draw.  This is a lie.  Everyone can draw; this is
amply attested by UFO eyewitness reports.  (These are also strong evidence that
very large objects are most naturally measured in terms of football fields.)

If someone says they are not a good drawer, that is closer to an honest statement,
but it still presupposes that there is such a thing as a "good drawing", and further,
that they can distinguish a "good" drawing from a "bad" one.  (Yet ask them to do so,
and they will probably beg off, saying they're no art critic.  So frustrating.)

I think it would be more accurate still to say that a lot of people simply do not
like *how* they draw.

The artworld does not hold drawing in high regard.  It's not like that most-favoured
child of the artworld, oil painting, oh no. [(Footnote 1)](#footnote-1)
Let us now recoil in horror in unison over the fact that *mere children* do it.

I would like drawing to be held in higher regard than it is.

Mathematics has been called "the queen and the servant of the sciences", because it
is both fantastically useful to each branch of science individually, and grandly
unifying to the sciences.

Perhaps we could say something similar for drawing, that drawing is the queen and servant
of the arts.  Not just practice and preparatory sketches for paintings, but also
architectural drawings, dance diagrams, set designs, fashion drawings...

Methods of Drawing
------------------

There are three basic ways of drawing anything: from life, from a reference, and
from the imagination.  Each of these ways has their own advantages and disadvantages,
their pros and cons.

### Drawing from Life

You are drawing something "from life" if that thing is right in front of you, even
if that thing is dead.  "Life" probably refers to your own life, in this context.

Drawn this way, the result will itself usually have more "life" in it.  Critics use
fancy art-words like _brio_ or _élan_ to describe this.

...

### Drawing from a Reference

Often this is a photograph, although it could also be another drawing.

The trick here is avoid slavishly copying the reference.

...

### Drawing from the Imagination

William Blake was big on this.  (Cézanne too, but he was a painter, not a drawer.)

Piranesi and Tiepolo, too, and Leonardo too, for that matter, because _invenzione_
was big in the renaissance.

People will sometimes say "drawing from memory" instead of "from the imagination",
and I see what they're getting at, but the latter seems more accurate.  Memory is
a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for imagination.  I have to remember
what a horse looks like, and what a horn looks like, but I have to imagine what
a unicorn looks like.

Unicorns!  Don't get me started on unicorns.  They're an aesthetics researchers
favourite animal to fixate on.  Because a drawing of a unicorn isn't a
*representation* of a unicorn, you see, because they don't exist, you see, and
you can't *represent* something that doesn't exist, you see, and I know they
don't exist because I've visited every planet in the galaxy and I've never seen
one on any of them.

Books
-----

I've read a number of "How to Draw X" books, of course, but they don't tend to
go into much depth.  (Deconstruct the subject into a number of tin-cans.  OK.
Try different media and grounds until you find what you like.  OK...)

It wasn't until I encountered these two books that I felt I had really found
studies of drawing _per se_:

##### Footnote 1

Yes, even still now in the contemporary age, despite what the Stuckists will
try to make you believe in order to curry sympathy from you, oil painting is
still basically regarded as "the" art form.  The reasons for this are beyond
the scope of this essay, since this is an essay about drawing, not painting.
But since you asked: prestige, portability, and durability contribute to
market value, and let's face it, the art market rules the artworld.  Sorry.
