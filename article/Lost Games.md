Lost Games
==========

Some games I seen then I never seen again since, and I might never see them
again, ain't it a pity?

### Darts game

*   seen-on: Apple II
*   released: 1979

Publisher might have been Apple Computer, Inc.  I remember the copyright
year was 1979.

Basically it was a darts game.  Your player stood on the left, the
dartboard was on the right, and you threw the dart in an arc and hoped
to hit the dartboard.

### Canadian politics simulator

*   seen-on: Apple II

I have no idea how I'd find this again.  It may have been local to
the University of Manitoba in the early 1980's, as far as I know.

It was basically a multiple-choice strategy game where you played a
politician of some kind.  A member of parliament, seems likely.
Like, a backbencher, trying to work their way up?  Maybe.

It was mostly text-based where it presented you with scenarios
as time progressed -- like, what is the political issue you have
to deal with this month -- and you chose how to respond.

For example, I remember one of the options was to take a
"Red Tory" response.

There were occasionally hi-res graphics, for when you (I guess) made a
particularly good, or poor, political move.

There was one that was a crow that had been killed.  With an arrow
through it?  It was paired with some idiom like "killing the crow".
It may have been "eating crow"; that seems more likely as an idiom,
but I don't remember the graphic involving eating in any way.

### Mountain survival game

*   seen-on: Apple II

Played in school.  You picked what to take from the crashed plane.
There were some colour hi-res graphics.

### Very simple civiliation-type game

*   seen-on: Apple II

Played in school.  You had to find fertile soil.  ISTR there were
some very simple black-and-white hi-res graphics.

### Maze escape with people

*   seen-on: Apple II

Lo-res graphics.  You had to find the exit to a maze, displayed
in 1st-person perspective.  Sometimes you would meet other people
in the maze.  They wore hats.  Sometimes they would answer questions
and sometimes they would have maps.  You could ask them if they
told the truth and they would say useless things like "I always
tell the truth" or "Sometimes I tell the truth".

Might have been written in Integer BASIC.

### Galactic conquest

*   seen-on: Apple II

I might be able to find that one, because I'm pretty sure that
was its name.  Or something similar.  Text mode, with inverse
characters for some things.
