Lost Games
==========

Some games I seen then I never seen again since, and I might never see them
again, ain't it a pity?

### Darts

*   seen-on: Apple II
*   released: 1979

Publisher might have been Apple Computer, Inc.  I remember the copyright
year was 1979.

Basically it was a darts game.  Your player stood on the left, the
dartboard was on the right, and you threw the dart in an arc and hoped
to hit the dartboard.

### Canadian Politics Simulator

*   seen-on: Apple II

I have no idea how I'd find this again.  It may have been local to
the University of Manitoba in the early 1980's, as far as I know.

It was basically a multiple-choice strategy game where you played a
politician of some kind.  A member of parliament, seems likely.
Like, a backbencher, trying to work their way up?  Maybe.

It was mostly text-based where it presented you with scenarios
as time progressed -- like, what is the political issue you have
to deal with this month -- and you chose how to respond.

For example, I remember one of the options was to take a
"Red Tory" response.

There were occasionally hi-res graphics, for when you (I guess) made a
particularly good, or poor, political move.

There was one that was a crow that had been killed.  With an arrow
through it?  It was paired with some idiom like "killing the crow".
It may have been "eating crow"; that seems more likely as an idiom,
but I don't remember the graphic involving eating in any way.
