Lost Games
==========

These are games that I've encountered in the past, and which I haven't been
able to find any information about on the Internet, in part because I may
not remember their exact names.  (City Connection was in this category for
a long time until somehow I remembered its (non-obvious) name.)

### Darts game

*   seen-on: Apple II
*   released: 1979

Publisher might have been Apple Computer, Inc.  I remember the copyright
year was 1979.

Basically it was a darts game.  Your player stood on the left, the
dartboard was on the right, and you threw the dart in an arc and hoped
to hit the dartboard.

### Canadian politics simulator

*   seen-on: Apple II

I have no idea how I'd find this again.  It may have been local to
the University of Manitoba in the early 1980's, as far as I know.

It was basically a multiple-choice strategy game where you played a
politician of some kind.  A member of parliament, seems likely.
Like, a backbencher, trying to work their way up?  Maybe.

It was mostly text-based where it presented you with scenarios
as time progressed -- like, what is the political issue you have
to deal with this month -- and you chose how to respond.

For example, I remember one of the options was to take a
"Red Tory" response.

There were occasionally hi-res graphics, for when you (I guess) made a
particularly good, or poor, political move.

There was one that was a crow that had been killed.  With an arrow
through it?  It was paired with some idiom like "killing the crow".
It may have been "eating crow"; that seems more likely as an idiom,
but I don't remember the graphic involving eating in any way.

### Maze escape with people

*   seen-on: Apple II

Lo-res graphics.  You had to find the exit to a maze, displayed
in 1st-person perspective.  Sometimes you would meet other people
in the maze.  They wore hats.  Sometimes they would answer questions
and sometimes they would have maps.  You could ask them if they
told the truth and they would say useless things like "I always
tell the truth" or "Sometimes I tell the truth".

Might have been written in Integer BASIC.

### Galactic conquest

*   seen-on: Apple II

That's not its name, and it's not Galactic Empire or Galactic Attack.

Text mode, with inverse characters for some things.

There was a grid of numbers indicating planets and their populations(?)
but I don't remember there being any spatial relationship between them.

### Castle game on PET

*   seen-on: Commodore PET

I remember attending some kind of programming course on Commodore PET
computers in the University of Winnipeg's computer lab, and seeing
other students playing games on their computers.  I'm probably
forgetting most of these, but one stands out.  It used the graphic
characters to display something that looked like a castle, from
above, with paths around the edge (as if walking along battlements?),
and (I believe) using the spade card suite symbol to denote a guard.
And you went along these battlements and fought the guards?  Probably,
but I don't remember that much of it.  I only saw it that one time,
so for all I know, it was written by the person who was playing it,
and is completely unknown in the rest of the world, but that seems
unlikely.

There might have also been spellcasting in this, with the protagonist
being some kind of wizard, but I might be conflating it with other
games I saw at that time.

### Would you two like you join me on a fantasia?

*   seen-on: Arcade

Side-scrolling platformer.  You collected coins, among other
things, and there was a shop at the end of each level where
you could buy powerups.

The protagonists were a boy and a girl and at the beginning
of the game a cloaked figure came up to them and asked them
WOULD YOU TWO LIKE TO JOIN ME ON A FANTASIA? or similar.
