Recollected Games
=================

These are games which are possibly not remarkable enough nor classic enough
to be put in one of the other lists, but which I have memories of playing
(or at least seeing) regardless, and I'd like to note those memories somewhere.

This list is kind of a grab bag and will possibly never be as well organized
as the other lists.  There is a good chance any particular entry here will
move to some other list.

Commodore 64
------------

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

### Starquake

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starquake_(video_game)
*   published by: Bubble Bus Software

### Paradroid

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradroid

### The Castles of Dr. Creep

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castles_of_Dr._Creep

### Hovver Bovver

*   written by: Jeff Minter
*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Bovver

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

### Whistler's Brother

*   wikipedia: N/A
*   entry @ [atarimania](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-whistler-s-brother_5760.html)
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D2846)

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but a second character indirectly by influencing where
they go by whistling at them.

### Spindizzy

*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindizzy_(video_game)

### Zig Zag

*   wikipedia: N/A
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D2943)

Not to be confused with a different game called Zig Zag, also for the C64.

### Zeppelin

*   wikipedia: N/A
*   entry @ [lemon64](http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D2940)
*   entry @ [c64-wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Zeppelin)

Notable because you can shoot out bits of wall.

### Night Flight, an I.F.R. Simulator

*   written by: Tim Gerchmez
*   available for: Commodore 64

Notable for the fact that it was a flight simulator with no graphics.
Well, only the control panel.  Given that you were supposed to be
flying at night over a lightless plain, that's essentially reasonable.

In fact IFR simulators were "a thing" and there are more than one for
the Commodore 64, but this one is for the C64 only and is freeware.

TODO: I should write about IFR simulators here a bit.

Arcade
------

### Bomb Jack

*   available for: Arcade

I remember seeing it in Portugal.

### Springer

*   available for: Arcade

I remember seeing it in an airport in Mexico.

### Kickman

*   available for: Arcade

I remember it from a café in a small farming community in Manitoba.

### Crazy Climber

*   available for: Arcade

I remember it from a café in a small farming community in Manitoba.

### Cloak & Dagger

*   wikipedia: [Cloak & Dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak_%26_Dagger_(video_game))
*   genre: Shoot-'em-Up
*   available for: Arcade
*   controls: dual joystick

There's something that's always attracted me about being able to shoot out
bits of wall. The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar draw. Not sure if
I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.

I remember seeing this at a 7-11 near where my sister was living at the time.

Console
-------

### Katamari Damacy

*   wikipedia: [Katamari Damacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy)
*   published by: Namco
*   genre: Maze-Runner (nominally)
*   available for: Sony PlayStation
*   controls: dual analog joystick

An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional maze game where the
fourth dimension is scale. Rolling things up is also surprisingly satisfying
and disturbingly addictive. To top it all off, the soundtrack can't be beat.

### Super Monkey Ball 2

*   wikipedia: [Super Monkey Ball 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_2)
*   genre: Maze-Runner
*   available for: Nintendo GameCube
*   controls: analog joystick

I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden
mazes that you tilt with the two dials — which is essentially what this
game is. But somehow it manages to be fun. Especially when you start
barrelling down a spiral, completely out of control. The party games I could
mostly do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun
as the main game.

Some students had borrowed a video projector from the lab, and hooked it
up to their GameCube.  I played this on it, projected on the wall.
IMAX style.  It was vertigo-inducing.

Commodore 64
------------

### Big Mac

*   available for: Commodore 64

Full title is "Big Mac The Maintenance Man", I think.

### Slinky

*   available for: Commodore 64

This one might be of note.

### Crossroads

*   available for: Commodore 64

One of the best type-in games.

### Lava Flow

*   available for: Commodore 64

An interesting type-in game.  The lava works like a cellular automaton,
a bit.

### Everyone's a Wally

*   available for: Commodore 64

### Ultimate Wizard

*   available for: Commodore 64
*   published by: Electronic Arts

Obviously influenced by Jumpman.  Jumpman with spells and a construction
kit, really.

Apple II
--------

### Swashbuckler

*   available for: Apple II
*   wikipedia: [Swashbuckler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashbuckler_(video_game))
*   online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Swashbuckler_1982_Datamost)

The weird contrast between the coloured background vs. the black-and-white
(or green, as the case may have been, on the monochrome monitor on which I
saw it) figures of the characters makes it stand out in my mind.

### Sammy Lightfoot

*   available for: Apple II, others
*   wikipedia: [Sammy Lightfoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Lightfoot)
*   online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Sammy_Lightfoot_1983_Sierra_cr_Mr._Krac_Man_o)

OK, so this is actually only listed here because there was a demo
called "Kill Sammy" which used the assets from Sammy Lightfoot, but
instead of being the game, let you select from a menu the way in
which Sammy should meet his demise (laser, being squished by something,
etc.)

You can see "Kill Sammy" online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Kill_Sammy_19xx_Grue_The).

### Penny Arcade

*   written by: Bill Budge
*   genre: Sports
*   available for: Apple II
*   published by: Apple Computer, Inc.
*   release date: 1979
*   controls: paddles
*   video @ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h67eM0RAdM)

OK, so mainly this is notable because it was written as a machine-language
routine "attached" to a BASIC program.  So you loaded and ran it like a BASIC
program, but all the BASIC part was doing was calling the machine-language
part.  And when you LISTed the BASIC program, all that was visible was 
the BASIC part.

To a kid like me at the time, that made it seem like an effing *mystery*.

### Lemonade Stand

*   available for: Apple II
*   wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand
*   online @ [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/a2_Lemonade_Stand_1979_Apple)

This is probably a classic.

Summer is endless, unlike in the Commodore 64 version.

Licensed Characters
-------------------

These are notable because they are generally terrible.  But occasionally
they have some redeeming characteristics.

### The Young Ones

*   available for: Commodore 64

Notable because they made a video game based on The Young Ones.

Has some redeeming characteristics.

### Danger Mouse

*   available for: Commodore 64

This one might be of note, but not because it was a good game.

### Trap Door

*   available for: Commodore 64

This one might be of note too.

Has some redeeming characteristics.

### Other Licensed Character Games

for NES: Spot (7-Up) (also Fido??); the Noid (Domino's Pizza).
