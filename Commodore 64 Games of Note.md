Commodore 64 Games of Note
==========================

A special collection because Commodore 64.

Some of these aren't totally Commodore 64-specific, and had conversions
on (or were a conversion from) other systems.

### Starquake

### Paradroid

### Fire Ant

### Pharaoh's Curse

### Necromancer

### Castles of Dr. Creep

### Hovver Bovver

Didn't realize "bovver" was "bother" until I was older.

### Whistler's Brother

Notable for gameplay mechanic: the player controls one character directly
with a joystick, but a second character indirectly by influencing where
they go by whistling at them.

### Ultimate Wizard

### Dynamite Dan

### Spindizzy

### Zig Zag

### Rock Star Ate My Hamster

### Racked Off

### Joe Gunn

### Fairy Well
